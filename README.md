# 👋 Hi there, I'm Stephen!

🚀 **System and Cloud Engineer | DevOps Enthusiast | Infrastructure as Code Advocate**

I'm passionate about building secure, scalable, and automated cloud infrastructure. I have hands-on experience with tools like Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, as well as implementing secure communications using SSL/TLS certificates, Java Keytool, and keystores. I also bring a solid background in web development, working extensively with web servers such as Tomcat and Apache2.

I've also managed identity and access control using platforms like Microsoft Entra ID and Keycloak for SSO, RBAC, and OAuth2/OpenID integration. I thrive in fast-paced DevOps environments where automation and efficiency are key.
